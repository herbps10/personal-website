[ModularEEG](http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/modeeg/modeeg.html) is a open source design for an EEG device you can build yourself. My friend Nick and I have been working towards building our device based on the ModularEEG project.

The first step was to layout out a circuit board using the schematics provided on the ModularEEG site. Fortunately for us, my Dad is an electrical engineer who specializes in digital signal processing. He helped us interpret the schematics and lay out the circuit board.

The order was submitted to a company out in Oregon which prints circuit boards from custom layouts. While we were at it, we ordered two copies.
